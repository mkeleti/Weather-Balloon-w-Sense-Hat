# Weather-Balloon-w-Sense-Hat by Michael Keleti
''' 
Hello my name is Michael Keleti and I created this for my 8th Grade Project as a way to show kids how Humidity, Temperature, Pressure, and Altitude can be calculated and applied through research. 

Interactive:
Use the joystick to display Pressure, Humidity, Temperature, and Altitude.
Use the center button to exit the script/loop

Datalogger:
Currently WIP
This will log the data from the sense hat
